# brew-ds

> A Data Scientist is just a statistician with a Mac

`brew-ds` aims to set up your MacOS or linux system with common Data Science tools using the package manager [brew](https://brew.sh/), R's `install.packages` and python's `pip`. Linux users please see [linuxbrew](https://linuxbrew.sh).

## Usage

```bash
git clone git@github.com:nathaneastwood/brew-ds.git
cd brew-ds
. build.sh
```
You may be prompted for your password.


## Warning

Linux is untested but hopefully doesn't work too terribly. We have not attempted to add any PPAs, portage overlays, AUR packages etc. as you might not want them on your system.
